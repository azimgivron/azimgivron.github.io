      As an R&D Engineer in neutronics, I have led the development and integration of advanced computational tools and surrogate models to accelerate reactor design and analysis. My key contributions include:
      - Geometry Automation: Designed and implemented software that streamlines the creation of complex reactor geometries (Computer Aided Design and Constructive Solid Geometry), reducing setup time and error rates.
      - Data-Scarce Regression: Developed regression methods tailored for very small datasets (3 to 6 points), incorporating prior curve knowledge and rigorous uncertainty quantification.
      - Radioactive-Gas Transport: Built a coupled 1D multiphysics code to model the transport of radioactive gases.
      - Data Pipeline Engineering: Architected a centralized data-processing pipeline to facilitate seamless sharing, storage and retrieval of experimental and simulation results.
      - Transient Neutron Kinetics: Created 0D and 1D neutron-kinetics solversâ€”based on point-kinetics and transient fission-matrix techniquesâ€”for rapid reactivity-insertion studies in molten-salt reactors.
      - Surrogate Multiphysics Modeling: Developed a fast, multiphysics surrogate (neutronics, thermomechanics, thermohydraulics) framework to enable rapid prototyping and optimization of novel reactor concepts.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Azim Givron**. I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven, in the Electrical Engineering department (ESAT). My research lies at the intersection of **genomics and machine learning**, with a focus on bioinformatics applications.

I started this website not just to share my career journey, but also to create a space where I can share ideas and knowledge. Iâ€™ll be writing blog posts about my research, but also about **AI ethics** and broader topics that affect all of us.

My goal is to make AI easier to understand. Itâ€™s not some mysterious technology only for expertsâ€”AI is already shaping the world around us, and I want to help you see how it works and why it matters.
