        Matrix completion using deep neural networks via advanced optimization techniques This research aims to develop a matrix completion framework incorporating both Euclidean and non-Euclidean methodologies to effectively capture complex data structures. 
        
        Nonsmooth regularization techniques, such as the $\ell_1$-norm and nuclear norm, are integrated to promote sparsity and low-rank structure in the reconstructed matrices. To address the resulting optimization challenges, advanced smoothing strategiesâ€”specifically proximal gradient methods and forward-backward splittingâ€”are employed.
        
        By combining deep modeling with robust mathematical optimization, the proposed approach is designed to enhance imputation accuracy, particularly in the presence of irregular and high-dimensional data. The method will be validated on real-world datasets from recommendation systems and biomedical domains, such as rare diseases and gene prioritization, demonstrating improved performance over traditional techniques.
